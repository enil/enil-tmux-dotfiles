# enil-tmux-dotfiles

My tmux dotfiles, use at your own risk and have fun!
The configuration should work both on OS X and Linux with tmux 1.9 and 2.0.

## Installation

Run `make install` and it will generate and symlink everything to the home directory.
I prefer to keep the git under `~/.dotfiles/tmux`.

If any of the installed files already exists in the home directory it will be moved to a backup file with the suffix
`.bak` added to the filename.
